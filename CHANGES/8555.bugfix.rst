Restored the ability to create
 :py:class:`aiohttp.TCPConnector`,
 :py:class:`aiohttp.ClientSession`,
 :py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.ThreadedResolver`
 :py:class:`aiohttp.web.Server`,
 and :py:class:`aiohttp.CookieJar` instances
 without a running event loop -- by :user:`bdraco`.

This is a partial revert of :issue:`5278`. Creating these
objects without a running event loop is highly discouraged
because it can lead to confusing behavior.

This is accomplished by falling back to calling
``asyncio.get_event_loop()`` if ``asyncio.get_running_loop()``
raises :exc:`RuntimeError`. As of Python 3.12, calling
``asyncio.get_running_loop()`` without a running event loop
also emits a Deprecation warning.

As with Python, creating these objects without a running event
loop will become an error in a future version of ``aiohttp``.
